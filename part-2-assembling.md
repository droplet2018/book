1. Environment &Location

   a.  The electricity supply must be stable, free from momentary high voltage and interference.

   b.  The Machine must be grounded.

   c.  To reach the best printing quality, please assemble your printer on the production line and pls be sure the flowing production line is stable.

   d.  Any warped edges that pass through the printinghead might lower the printing quality.

   e.  Please keep a certain distance between the printed products, so that the sensor can detect the printed products smoothly.

   f.  The metal supporter for machine must be places horizontally without any vibration.

   g.  Inkjet printer must be assembled horizontally without any lean front or lean back, or ink will leak or can not print out.

   h.  The rated voltage for Inkjet Printer is 110V-220V/50-60H


2. Ink cartridge assembling
i.  The ink supply is ink cartridge. It's easy and simple to replace ink cartridge.

3. Sensor assembling

 The sensor must be assembled in front of the printinghead, either left or right. The exact position depends on the flowing direction of product. When the sensor detects the product, it starts counting the time and will start printing when reaching the delay time. Pls be sure a certain distance between products, or the sensor can not detect the printed products smoothly. Please refer to following pictures.

4. The relative position of printinghead and ink cartridge

   l.  If the printinghead is higher than the recommended location, the inkjet printer will not start printing.

   m.  If the printinghead is lower than the recommended location, the ink will leak from the printinghead.

   n.  When assembling printinghead, the distance between the bottom of printinghead and bottom of machine should be 30mm\~50mm. If it's higher than 50mm, the spray head will not begin printing. If it's lower than 30mm,the ink will leak. Please refer to following picture.
