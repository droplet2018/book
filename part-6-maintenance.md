**When using your printer , please pay special attention on the following points.**

a.The solvent-based ink are fast-day ink, while the oil-based ink takes longer time to dry. That means you need to print continuously when using the solvent-based ink to avoid the ink at outside of nozzles drying.

b.After the power is turned off, the ink around the nozzles will dry very soon. If you want to re-start the machine, you must clean the printinghead with cleaning solvent and squeeze the ink cartridge

C. The ink drying time depends on the environment and the ink drops needed for the printing. For example, the higher temperature, the ink dries sooner. And the bolder character, the longer it will take to dry. You can choose to print light color characters to shorten the drying time.
