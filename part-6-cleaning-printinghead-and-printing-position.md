## 6.1Clean the (nozzles)

A.Before printing, please clean the nozzles with cleaning solvent. Spray the cleaning sovent to the nozzles 3-5 times until the dried ink on the nozzles is completely cleaned out. Please pay attention do not touch or clear the nozzles with any materials except cleaning solvent., no matter how soft the material is, or it will cause permanent damaging of printinghead.

B.Squeeze the ink cartridge

Squeeze the ink cartridge from the circle hole at the bottom of machine with your finger gently. You will see the ink flowing out from the printinghead, and meanwhile you will find there are small air bubble in the flowed ink. Keep squeeze until you cannot see the air bubble in the ink. Then wipe the ink around the printinghead with paper tissue . Please never wipe thenozzles. Attention: The maximum force the printinghead can withstand is 1bar (1 kg/cm²). Therefore please ensure the the maximum pressing force on the ink cartridge is 0.5KG. Never squeeze the ink cartridge directly without spraying cleaning solvent.

When squeeze the ink cartridge, the ink will flow out from the filter to ink tube to the nozzles. So the ink will pull out the air or cleaning solvent out completely, and make sure printer can print normally.

C.Check whether all the nozzles are working properly: Please edit a character with 18mm height, and place a piece of blank paper in front of the printinghead. The distance of paper and spray head should be within 5MM. Move the paper slowly from left to right.

D.Start printing and view the printed result. The printed out character should be high resolution without any disconnection. If the character has disconnection line, please repeat step A.B until all nozzles are not blocked and print

E.Start to edit the message and print

## 6.2Printing Position

a.Most customer would like to printing message on a designated location. For example, inside a frame or a blank. Therefore, it’s necessary to position the printer on a appropriate location. And you also need to set the conveyor belt and the printing parameters according to the direction of products.


b.The message should be printed on the right position for easy reading. For the vertical position, please adjust through the relative up/down key. For the horizontal postion, you can use the “Delay Printing “ function.

The Width is the width of the message. The larger the number, the wider the message is.

The Delay is the order of printing message. You can adjust the order of message by adjusting the delay parameters.

c.Before changing the printing message, please make ensure conveyor belt is working at a steady speed. If both the printing position and the printing width are changing, we recommend to install an encoder to esnure the accuracy of printing position.

d.You  can press the upper or lower arrow key  ![](/assets/Image_067.jpg)  to modify the Delay Setting during printing. The Delay Setting will be effective immediately after the modification


e.You can press the left or right direction key ![](/assets/Image_067.jpg)  to modify the Width Setting during printing.
The Width Setting will be effective immediately after the modification

f.After the sensor can detect the edge of product to be printed, it will start time counting till it reaches the delay time, then it will start printing.

**Attention: Message can be printed from left to right, or from right to left according to the direction of products.**
